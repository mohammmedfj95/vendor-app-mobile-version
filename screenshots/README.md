## Screenshot Guidelines

When adding new screenshots:

1. Create a new directory for the version if needed
2. Use descriptive names (e.g., `home_screen_dark.png`, `inventory_list_empty.png`)
3. Include both light and dark mode versions when relevant
4. Capture common use cases and edge cases
5. Maintain consistent device dimensions

## Required Screenshots for Each Version
